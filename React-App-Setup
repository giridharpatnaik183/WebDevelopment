React App Set-up
----------------
Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

# Check Node.js installation
node -v

# Check npm installation
npm -v

If not installed, you can download and install them from nodejs.org

Step 2: Create a React App
Open your terminal and run the following commands to create a new React app using Create React App:

npx create-react-app weighing-bridge-app
cd weighing-bridge-app

Step 3: Project Structure
Your project structure will look something like this:
weighing-bridge-app/

|-- src/
|   |-- App.js
|   |-- index.js
|-- public/
|-- node_modules/
|-- package.json
|-- ...

Step 4: Replace Existing Code
Replace the content of src/App.js with your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

Step 5: Install Axios for HTTP Requests
Since you'll likely need to communicate with a backend, let's install Axios for making HTTP requests:

npm install axios

Step 6: Create a Backend
For simplicity, you can use a tool like JSON Server as a fake REST API for testing. Install it globally:

npm install -g json-server

Create a file named db.json in the root of your project:

{
  "measurements": []
}

Run JSON Server:
json-server --watch db.json --port 3001

This will start a fake REST API at http://localhost:3001.

Step 7: Update App.js to Fetch and Display Data
Update src/App.js to use React Hooks and Axios to fetch data:

Step 8: Start the React App
Run your React app:

npm start
